I'm a PhD candidate in the University of California Irvine's [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/).

My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

I both study and help build robust public knowledge infrastructure, working with advocacy organizations, libraries, and museums.

Since 2020, I co-develop the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital collection that supports a transnational network of people concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Corporation, one of the world's largest petrochemical companies.

I'm a member of UC Irvine's [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab) and the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography](www.worldpece.org) (PECE).

My dissertation research is supported by the Social Science Research Council's International Dissertation Research Fellowship. I'm an alumn of the German-American Fulbright Foundation and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes).
