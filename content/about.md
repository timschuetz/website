Tim Schütz is a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine’s [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) and [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab). My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

My dissertation project explores the roles of data and visualization tools in advocacy around plastics and petrochemicals in the US, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 2020, I’ve been co-developing the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital workspace a digital collection that supports a transnational network of people concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Group. My field research is supported by the [Social Science Research Council (SSRC)](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/idrf/international-dissertation-research-fellowship), the [Environmental Data Justice Fund](https://www.environmentaljusticedatafund.com/), and the [International College of Innovation](https://ici.nccu.edu.tw/about-us/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei, where I’m a visiting scholar (until March 2024). 

I’m an active member of the Design Group for the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE). I’ve helped develop a series of PECE-supported projects and advised other research groups in the use of PECE as data and knowledge infrastructure. 

I studied Media, Communication, and Cultural Research in Bremen and Istanbul (BA) and Science and Technology Studies (MA) in Frankfurt. I’m an alumni of the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes) and the German-American Fulbright Foundation.

I grew up in Ostwestfalen, Germany and later moved to Reykjavík to volunteer in a community-based mental health center and study Icelandic. I've worked for communication agencies, digital media production companies, and collaborate with civic technology groups.
