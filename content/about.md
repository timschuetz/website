I'm a PhD candidate in the University of California Irvine's [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/).

My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

I both study and help build robust public knowledge infrastructure, working with advocacy organizations, libraries, and museums.

I'm a member of UC Irvine's [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab) and the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography](www.worldpece.org) (PECE).

My research has been supported by the Social Science Research Council, the German-American Fulbright program, and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung).
