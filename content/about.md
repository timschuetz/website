I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine’s [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) and [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab). 

My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

My ongoing dissertation project [https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/dissertation-project-informating-environmental-justice] explores the role of data and digital archives focused on the expansion of plastics and petrochemicals in the US, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 2020, I co-develop the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital workspace that supports a transnational network of researchers and advocates concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Group. 

I studied Media, Communication, and Cultural Research in Bremen and Istanbul (BA) and Science and Technology Studies (MA) in Frankfurt/Main. I received scholarshops from the Fulbright Foundation, German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes), Social Science Research Council (SSRC), and the Environmental Data Justice Fund. Until March 2024, I'm a visiting scholar at the [International College of Innovation](https://ici.nccu.edu.tw/about-us/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei.

I’m an active member of the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)](https://worldpece.org/) and open data editor for the journal [Engaging Science, Technology, and Society.](https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests).
