I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine’s [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) and [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab). My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

I studied Media, Communication, and Cultural Research in Bremen and Istanbul (BA) as well as Science and Technology Studies (MA) in Frankfurt. I received scholarshops from the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes) and the German-American Fulbright Foundation.

My dissertation project explores the role of data and digital archives focused on the expanding plastics and petrochemical production. My fiedwork in the US, Taiwan and Vietnam is supported by the [Social Science Research Council (SSRC)](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/idrf/international-dissertation-research-fellowship) and the [Environmental Data Justice Fund](https://www.environmentaljusticedatafund.com/). Until March 2024, I'm a visiting scholar at the [International College of Innovation](https://ici.nccu.edu.tw/about-us/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei.

Since 2020, I co-develop the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital workspace that supports a transnational network of people concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Group. 

I’m an active member of the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)](https://worldpece.org/) and open data editor for the journal [Engaging Science, Technology, and Society.](https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests).
