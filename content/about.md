I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine’s [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) and [EcoGovLab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fortunlab). My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements. I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power.

My current dissertation project explores the role of data in advocacy against expanding plastics and petrochemical production in the US, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Since 2020, I’ve been co-developing the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital workspace that supports a transnational network of people concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Group. The research is supported by the [Social Science Research Council (SSRC)](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/idrf/international-dissertation-research-fellowship) and the [Environmental Data Justice Fund](https://www.environmentaljusticedatafund.com/). Until March 2024, I'm a visiting scholar at the [International College of Innovation](https://ici.nccu.edu.tw/about-us/) at National Chengchi University in Taipei.

I’m an active member of the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)](https://worldpece.org/). I've supported research groups in the development of PECE-based knowledge infrastructure and currently serve as open data editor for [Engaging Science, Technology, and Society.](https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests).

I studied Media, Communication, and Cultural Research in Bremen and Istanbul (BA) and Science and Technology Studies (MA) in Frankfurt. I’m an alumni of the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes) and the German-American Fulbright Foundation.

I grew up in Ostwestfalen, Germany and later moved to Reykjavík, where I volunteered in the [Clubhouse Geysir](https://klubburinngeysir.is/) and studied Icelandic. I've also worked in digital media agencies, focusing on video production. I enjoy learning about visual design, science communication, and civic technology projects.
