I've got a professional background in digital video and sound production. Examples:

## U.S.EPA Video Challenge for Students

From 2022â€“23, I worked with a team of UC Irvine students (engineering and biology) and Orange County Environmental Justice (OCEJ) to shoot and produce two videos about soil lead contamination in Santa Ana, California. We submitted the videos to a competition held by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, focusing on the role of publicly available data (Phase 1) and developing a proposal to address the problem (Phase 2). Our team won both phases of the contest (see [UCI press release](https://www.socsci.uci.edu/newsevents/news/2023/2023-05-24-epa-video-challenge.php)).
