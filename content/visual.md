### U.S.EPA Video Challenge for Students

In 2022–23, I collaborated with a team of UC Irvine students from engineering and biology, along with Orange County Environmental Justice (OCEJ), to create two videos addressing soil lead contamination in Santa Ana, California. Our team won both phases of a video competition by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
