### U.S.EPA Video Challenge for Students

In 2022â€“23, I collaborated with a team of UC Irvine students from engineering and biology, along with Orange County Environmental Justice (OCEJ), to create two videos addressing soil lead contamination in Santa Ana, California. We submitted the videos to a competition hosted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, focusing on the use of publicly available data (Phase 1) and the development of a proposal to adress the issue (Phase 2). Our team won both phases of the competition, with a total of $70,000 in funding generated for further project implementation.
