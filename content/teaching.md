##### Projects in Analysis in Social Computing
(with Geoffrey C. Bowker | Roderic Crooks | Matthew Bietz). I assisted students in the design of short ethnographic projects that explore the role of computers in social situations, from food trucks to Kâ€“12 classrooms. Key methods are participant observation, document analysis, and developing prototypes of design interventions.
